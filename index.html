            <p>I am Laura Swofford, a freelance UX designer. I have a UX Design certificate from the University of Oregon and I specialize in content strategy and UX writing and enjoy solving user problems that involve creating clarity. </p>
 
             <p> My skills include Figma, Adobe, Miro, Trello, and more. I find joy in critical and analytical thinking while using words to solve problems. I have worn a lot of hats, like a paralegal doing research, analyzing data, and writing and editing with attorneys and managing multiple attorneys to stay track to meet deadlines; a photographer in the studio and on location creating design with different angles; a sports writer covering my local soccer team live in the press box with player interviews after games and leading the MLS writers group as head editor; a supervisor of adults with disabilities and their staff and writing learning programs and managing the implementation of those programs and data collection to ensure state funding. Every step along the way has given me transferable skills for the UX world.</p>
